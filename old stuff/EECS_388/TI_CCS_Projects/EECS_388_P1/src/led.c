 *  	"delay" is best calculated as a fraction of the SysTick Frequency,
 *  		such that it has the form:  SYSTICK_FREQUENCY * (delay between executions in milliseconds)
 *  		this is done so that the SysTick frequency can be altered without having to change the
 *  		delay values for previously defined tasks.

     * Start G<2> signal HIGH so the LED is lit at the start
     * The GPIOPinWrite function requires the Port and pins as the first arguments
     * 		the third argument has to be a bit-packed byte that represents the
     * 		desired state of the given pins.
     * 		The least-significant-bit of this byte (bit 0) represents pin 0 on the specified port,
     * 		the next LSB (bit 1) represents pin 1 and so on...
     * 	To write pin G<2> HIGH we have to pass the value 0x04 (or the constant representing the pin),
     * 	For example, if we wanted pin G<1> HIGH =>
     * 			GPIOPinWrite(GPIO_PORTG_BASE, GPIO_PIN_1, GPIO_PIN_1)
     * 		and if we wanted pin G<7> LOW =>
     * 			GPIOPinWrite(GPIO_PORTG_BASE, GPIO_PIN_7, 0x00)
     * 	The function can be used to write multiple pins as well,
     * 		if we wanted pins G<1> and G<2> HIGH =>
     * 			GPIOPinWrite(GPIO_PORTG_BASE, (GPIO_PIN_1 | GPIO_PIN_2), (GPIO_PIN_1 | GPIO_PIN_2))
     * 			or G<1> HIGH and G<2> LOW =>
     * 			GPIOPinWrite(GPIO_PORTG_BASE, (GPIO_PIN_1 | GPIO_PIN_2), GPIO_PIN_1)
     * 		the pin arguments are combined with a bit-wise OR operation
     * 		and the desired signal value given is a bit-wise OR'ing of the individual pin values.

     * 		number is written in hexadecimal notation.
     * 			So, 0x02 = 2, 0x0F = 15, and 0x10 = 16
     *
     * 		Likewise binary values can be given with the prefix 0b
     * 			So, 0b0 = 0, 0b10 = 2, and 0b111 = 7
     *
     * 		These notations can make the code easier to understand in some cases
