\section*{E\+E\+CS 678 -\/ Project 1 -\/ Quash Shell}

\end{quote}


\subsection*{Introduction}

In this project, you will complete the Quite a Shell (quash) program using the U\+N\+IX system calls. You may work in groups of 2. The purpose of this project is as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Getting familiar with the Operating System (U\+N\+IX) interface.
\item Exercising U\+N\+IX system calls.
\item Understanding the concept of a process from the user point of view.
\end{DoxyItemize}

A skeleton has been provided, but it lacks most of the core functionality one would expect from a shell program. Quash should behave similar to csh, bash or other popular shell programs.

\subsection*{Installation}

To build Quash use\+: \begin{quote}
{\ttfamily make} \end{quote}


To generate this documentation in H\+T\+ML and La\+TeX use\+: \begin{quote}
{\ttfamily make doc} \end{quote}


To clean quash use\+: \begin{quote}
{\ttfamily make clean} \end{quote}


\subsection*{Usage}

To run Quash use\+: \begin{quote}
{\ttfamily ./quash} \end{quote}
or \begin{quote}
{\ttfamily make test} \end{quote}


\subsection*{Features}

{\itshape {\bfseries The main file you will modify is \hyperlink{execute_8c}{src/execute.\+c}. You may not use or modify files in the src/parsing directory, with the notable exception of the \hyperlink{parsing__interface_8h_a659361d40550d9776b6ea7fa69a836ce}{destroy\+\_\+parser()} function in src/parsing/parse\+\_\+interface.\+c if necessary. Your output should match our example result files exactly.}}

The following features should be implemented in Quash\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Quash should be able to run executables (the basic function of a shell) with command line parameters
\item If the executable is not specified in the absolute or relative path format (starting with sequences of ‘/’, \textquotesingle{}./\textquotesingle{}, or \textquotesingle{}../\textquotesingle{}), quash should search the directories in the environment variable P\+A\+TH (see below). If no executable file is found, quash should print an error message to standard error. Quash should allow both foreground and background executions. Character ‘\&’ is used to indicate background execution. Commands without ‘\&’ are assumed to run in foreground.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When a command is run in the background, quash should print\+: \char`\"{}\+Background
      job started\+: \mbox{[}\+J\+O\+B\+I\+D\mbox{]}    P\+I\+D    C\+O\+M\+M\+A\+N\+D\char`\"{}
\item When a background command finishes, quash should print\+: \char`\"{}\+Completed\+:
      \mbox{[}\+J\+O\+B\+I\+D\mbox{]}    P\+I\+D    C\+O\+M\+M\+A\+N\+D\char`\"{}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 [QUASH]$ program1 &
2 Background job started: [1]    2342    program1 &
3 [QUASH]$ ls
4 Documents Downloads
5 Completed: [1]    2342    program1 &
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Quash should implement I/O redirection. The {\ttfamily $<$} character is used to redirect the standard input from a file. The {\ttfamily $>$} character is used to redirect the standard output to a file while truncating the file. The {\ttfamily $>$$>$} string is used to redirect the standard output to a file while appending the output to the end of the file.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 [QUASH]$ echo Hello Quash! > a.txt  # Write "Hello Quash!\(\backslash\)n" to a file
2 [QUASH]$ cat a.txt
3 Hello Quash!
4 [QUASH]$ echo Hey Quash! > a.txt  # Truncate the previous contents of a.txt and write "Hey Quash!\(\backslash\)n" to the
       file
5 [QUASH]$ cat a.txt          # Print file contents. If we didn't actually truncate we would see "Hey
       Quash!h!\(\backslash\)n" as the output of this command.
6 Hey Quash!
7 [QUASH]$ cat < a.txt        # Make cat read from a.txt via standard in
8 Hey Quash!
9 [QUASH]$ cat < a.txt > b.txt  # Multiple redirect. Read from a.txt and write to b.txt.
10 [QUASH]$ cat b.txt
11 Hey Quash!
12 [QUASH]$ cat a.txt >> b.txt  # Append output of a.txt to b.txt
13 [QUASH]$ cat b.txt
14 Hey Quash!
15 Hey Quash!
16 [QUASH]$
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Quash should support pipes {\ttfamily $\vert$}.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 [QUASH]$ cat src/quash.c | grep running
2 // Check if loop is running
3 bool is\_running() \{
4   return state.running;
5   state.running = false;
6   while (is\_running()) \{
7 [QUASH]$ cat src/quash.c | grep running | grep return
8   return state.running;
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Built-\/in Functions}

All built-\/in commands should be implemented in quash itself. They cannot be external programs of any kind. Quash should support the following built-\/in functions\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily echo} -\/ Print a string given as an argument. The output format should be the same as bash (a string followed by new line \textquotesingle{}\textbackslash{}n\textquotesingle{})
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 [QUASH]$ echo Hello world! 'How are you today?'
2 Hello world! How are you today?
3 [QUASH]$ echo $HOME/Development
4 /home/jrobinson/Development
5 [QUASH]$
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item export -\/ Sets the value of an environment variable. Quash should support reading from and writing to environment variables.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 [QUASH]$ export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin  # Set the PATH environment variable
2 [QUASH]$ echo $PATH                 # Print the current value of PATH
3 /usr/bin:/bin
4 [QUASH]$ echo $HOME
5 /home/jrobinson
6 [QUASH]$ export PATH=$HOME  # Set the PATH environment variable to the value of HOME
7 [QUASH]$ echo $PATH         # Print the current value of PATH
8 /home/jrobinson
9 [QUASH]$
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily cd} -\/ Change current working directory. This updates both the actual working directory and the P\+WD environment variable.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 [QUASH]$ echo $PWD
2 /home/jrobinson
3 [QUASH]$ cd ..              # Go up one directory
4 [QUASH]$ echo $PWD
5 /home
6 [QUASH]$ cd $HOME           # Go to path in the HOME environment variable
7 /home/jrobinson
8 [QUASH]$
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily pwd} -\/ Print the absolute path of the current working directory. Make sure you are printing out the actual working directory and not just the P\+WD environment variable.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 [QUASH]$ pwd                # Print the working directory
2 /home/jrobinson
3 [QUASH]$ echo $PWD          # Print the PWD environment variable
4 /home/jrobinson
5 [QUASH]$ export PWD=/usr    # Change the PWD environment variable
6 [QUASH]$ pwd
7 /home/jrobinson
8 [QUASH]$ echo $PWD
9 /usr
10 [QUASH]$
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily quit} \& {\ttfamily exit} -\/ Use these to terminate quash. These are already implemented for you.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 [BASH]$ ./quash
2 Welcome...
3 [QUASH]$ exit
4 [BASH]$ ./quash
5 Welcome...
6 [QUASH]$ quit
7 [BASH]$
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily jobs} -\/ Should print all of the currently running background processes in the format\+: \char`\"{}\mbox{[}\+J\+O\+B\+I\+D\mbox{]} P\+I\+D C\+O\+M\+M\+A\+N\+D\char`\"{} where J\+O\+B\+ID is a unique positive integer quash assigns to the job to identify it, P\+ID is the P\+ID of the child process used for the job, and C\+O\+M\+M\+A\+ND is the command used to invoke the job.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 [QUASH]$ find -type f | grep '*.c' > out.txt &
2 Background job started: [1]    2342    find / -type f | grep '*.c' > out.txt &
3 [QUASH]$ sleep 15 &
4 Background job started: [2]    2343    sleep 15 &
5 [QUASH]$ jobs               # List currently running background jobs
6 [1]    2342    find / -type f | grep '*.c' > out.txt &
7 [2]    2343    sleep 15 &
8 [QUASH]$
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Useful System Calls and Library Functions}

The following is a list and brief description of some system calls and library functions you may want to use and their respective man page entries. Note that this list may not be exhaustive, but be sure what ever library functions you use will run on the lab machines\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item chdir(2) -\/ Changes the current working directory
\item close(2) -\/ Closes a file descriptor
\item dup2(2) -\/ Copies a file descriptor into a specified entry in the file descriptor table
\item execvp(3) -\/ Replaces the current process with a new process
\item fork(2) -\/ Creates a new process by duplicating the calling process
\item getenv(3) -\/ Reads an environment variable from the current process environment
\item getwd(3) -\/ Gets the current working directory as a string (get\+\_\+current\+\_\+dir\+\_\+name(3) may be easier to use)
\item get\+\_\+current\+\_\+dir\+\_\+name(3) -\/ Gets the current working directory and stores it in a newly allocated string
\item kill(2) -\/ Sends a signal to a process with a given pid
\item open(2) -\/ Opens a file descriptor with an entry at the specified path in the file system
\item pipe(2) -\/ Creates a unidirectional communication pathway between two processes
\item printf(3) -\/ Prints to the screen
\item realpath(3) -\/ Resolves a relative path string to its equivalent absolute path string
\item setenv(3) -\/ Sets an environment variable in the current process environment
\item waitpid(2) -\/ Waits or polls for a process with a given pid to finish
\end{DoxyItemize}

You may N\+OT use the system(3) function anywhere in your project

\subsection*{Grading Policy}

Partial credit will be given for incomplete programs. However, a program that cannot compile will get 0 points. The feature tests are placed into multiple tiers of completeness. The output to standard out from your code must match our output exactly, except for whitespace, for the next tier of grading to be accessible. This is due to reliance of previous tiers in subsequent tier tests. If we cannot run your code in one tier then it becomes far more difficult test later tiers. The point breakdown for features is below\+:

\subsection*{Submission}

Each group should submit the project to your TA via Blackboard. Create a zip file of your code using \char`\"{}make submit\char`\"{}. You should also check that the zipped project still builds and runs correctly after building the submit target with \char`\"{}make unsubmit\char`\"{}. Your TA will be using this command to extract and build your project so make sure it works correctly. If you modify either of these targets, please ensure all file extensions are renamed to \char`\"{}.\+txt\char`\"{} in the submission and extract correctly with the unsubmit target.

\subsection*{Miscellaneous}

Start early! You need to use C language to implement this project.
